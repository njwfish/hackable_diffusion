# This file is here so that users can easily import the codebase as:
# from hackable_diffusion import hd

# Having this "hd.py" file rather than an __init__.py in the lib directory has
# the advantage that that subdirectories / submodules can be imported
# individually, without triggering an import of the entire codebase.
