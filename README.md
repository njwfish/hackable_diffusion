# Hackable diffusion

Hackable Diffusion is a modular toolbox written in Jax to experiment and educate
around Diffusion modeling.

## Philosophy

The core philosophy of this library is **hackability**. It is designed from the
ground up to be modular, composable, and easy to modify, enabling rapid
experimentation with new research ideas. Key principles include:

*   **Composition over Configuration**: Build models and training loops by composing small, well-defined Python objects.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The codebase is organized into logical sub-libraries for architecture, corruption, inference, loss, and sampling.
*   **Native Multimodality**: The library has first-class support for handling multimodal data (e.g., images and text) through a consistent "Nested" component pattern that applies different diffusion parameters to different parts of the data.

## Tutorials

The `notebooks/` directory contains several tutorials to get you started:

*   **`2d_training.ipynb`**: A minimal example on a 2D toy dataset.
*   **`mnist.ipynb`**: Standard image diffusion on MNIST.
*   **`mnist_discrete.ipynb`**: An example of discrete diffusion.
*   **`mnist_multimodal.ipynb`**: A showcase of the multimodal capabilities, generating images and labels jointly.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use pip with the provided
`pyproject.toml` file:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To install development dependencies (for running tests), use:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This will install libraries such as JAX, Flax, and other utilities required to
run the code.
